# Neural Network Study Recommendation System

## Description
This project uses a neural network to classify students into academic risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on study habits and contextual features. The model is implemented using PyTorch and is designed as a reproducible machine learning pipeline. Based on the predicted risk level, the system outputs a recommended study plan.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or later

Install dependencies:
